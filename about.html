<p>Duordle is a word-guessing game inspired by the Hebrew word game called <a target="blank" href="https://milotayim.com/">Milotayim</a>, which is in its turn inspired by the popular game Wordle. In Duordle, players are challenged to guess two related words based on the given clues. The words could even be well-known names of people or places, or any other related pair of words.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: The goal of Duordle is to guess two related words of 4-6 letters.</p>
<p><strong>Hints</strong>: At the beginning of each game, players have no hints about the words or their relationship. After each guess, Duordle provides hints as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="box perfect"></span> indicates a correctly-positioned letter.</li>
    <li><span class="box imperfect"></span> indicates a letter that is present but incorrectly positioned.</li>
    <li><span class="box excluded"></span> indicates a letter that is not present in the word.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guessing</strong>: Players input their guesses into the letter boxes, using a physical keyboard or the on-screen keyboard. The game evaluates the guesses and provides feedback based on how close the guesses are to the correct words.</p>
<p><strong>Winning</strong>: The player wins the game by correctly guessing both words within a given number of guesses.</p>
<p>To create the word-relationship data, the Oxford Dictionary was used along with the <a target="blank" href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/">Datamuse API</a>.</p>
